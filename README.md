DuckShooter
===========

This is a little game that I made while I was bored without anything else to do in my workplace. Still has some little bugs, but is quite functional and fun. =)


There is no "How to Play" but it's very easy:
* Your objective is make as many points as you can shooting with your mouse on each Donald Duck.
* You can get more points if you hit the little bird that comes flying time to time.
* Be careful with the Daisy Duck. If you hit her, you will lost one point!
* There are 10 levels! Can you get there?!?!
